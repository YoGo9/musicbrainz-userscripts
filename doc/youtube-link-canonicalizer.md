## Why Canonicalize YouTube Links?

YouTube links should point to Channel IDs rather than a handle URL.
This helps prevent [link rot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link_rot),
since handle URLs can change at any time, while Channel IDs are
immutable and will not change. For more information about the
different kinds of YouTube channel URLs, see [this
